# Animated Graph

This project is a follow-along of
[Jasper Flick's Catlike Coding](https://catlikecoding.com/) Unity
[basics]https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/basics/) tutorials. This
repository covers the projects from Building a Graph all the way up to Organic
Variety.

## Part 1 - [Building a Graph](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/basics/building-a-graph/)

The first part of the project entails creating a graph of a sinusoidal wave that
animates over time, instantiating points through a C# script and moving them on
an update loop. I've also added graphed axes as well. The project uses Universal
Render Pipeline (URP) for speed-ups as well.

## Part 2 - [Mathematical Surfaces](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/basics/mathematical-surfaces/)

This section starts off with implementing other waves:

| Wave                       | Notes                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![img](img/multiWave.png)  | This wave is an addition of two sine waves.                                                                     |
| ![img](img/rippleWave.png) | A more complicated addition of sinusoidal waves.                                                                |
| ![img](img/spiderWave.png) | I created this interesting 'spider' periodic function on a whim. It devolves into aspiraling 3D effect quickly. |

Speaking of 3D...

| Wave                         | Notes                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![img](img/going3D.png)      | The project's core functionality was easily extended to 3 dimensions. |
| ![img](img/diagonalWave.png) | Of course, the third dimension can be wrapped into the structure...   |
| ![img](img/multiWaveXYZ.png) | Some interesting physical wave-like behavior can be seen here.        |
| ![img](img/rippleXYZ.png)    | I love how this one 'drops' in a physical sense.                      |
| ![img](img/crab.png)         | Extending the 'spider' to 3 dimensions returned to crab.              |

The next portion moved on from the XZ plane into more interesting meshes and
surfaces.
